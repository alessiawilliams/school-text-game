Welcome to the game.
You are stranded, alone, in a gated park during an apocalypse.
The gate underground to escape is electronically operated, but all power was lost in the city during The Event.
Your only hope is the backup generators scattered across the park.
Find, and activate, 4 of the 6 generators. The gate will then open.
Good luck, survivor.
 
Press RETURN to begin.
